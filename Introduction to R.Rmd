### Question 1 
**Create the variables with the following composition:**  
1. A vector containing each letter of your first name as its elements.  
2. A variable that contains your name concatenated from the vector created in (1)  
3. A variable containing a sequence from 100 to 120.  
4. Create a matrix of 3x3 dimensions that contains the even sequence of numbers starting from 2.  
5. Assign names to the variables.  



#### Start solution ####
### 1
x <- c("J","a","m","a","l")
x

### 2
myname <- c("Jamal")
name <- paste('may name is', myname)
name

### 3
sequence <- 100:120
sequence

###4
nmatrix <- matrix(seq(from = 2, length.out = 9, by = 2), 3 , 3)
nmatrix

###5

1. the data frame will have three columns: CustomerID, hasAccount, totalBalance  
2. Fill the data as follows  
    a. Alicia does not have an account. She is here for inquiry   
    b. Nancy is here to check on her account balance of USD 10,000.  
    c. Fernando is here to deposit USD 100 in his account which had no balance.  
    d. Louis will withdraw all his money from the account that had USD 2,000.   
    e. Diane is here for information.   
3. For customers that do not have a value, use NA as placeholder.  
4. Print the number of rows, columns and names for the data frame.  


```{r }
#### Start solution ####
```

CustomerID <- c("Alicia","Nancy","Fernando","Louis","Diane")
hasAccount <- c(F,T,T,T,F)

## Section 3: Functions

### Question 1
**Create a function called gcd that finds the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b:**  
1. a and b, should be taken as input.  
2. The function must print the GCD as well as return it.  
3. The output must be saved in a variable called answer.  


```{r }
#### Start solution ####
```

gcd <- function(a,b){
  if(a>b){
    max_num = a
  }else{
    max_num =b
  }
  for(i in 1:max_num) {
    if ((a %% i == 0) && (b %% i == 0)) {
      ret = i
    }
  }
  return(ret)
}

answer <- gcd(111,5)
answer

```{r }
#### End solution ####
```

### Question 2
**Create a function called allConditionsMeet, that checks whether two expressions evaluate to true:**  
1. a and b, should be taken as input.  
2. the function should check if a and b, both conditions, evaluate to True.  
3. The function must returns a boolean value.  
4. Using a method, print the arguments that function takes.  


```{r }
#### Start solution ####
```

allConditionsMeet <- function(a,b){
    if(a==b){
        return(TRUE)
    }else{
        return(FALSE)
    }
}

allConditionsMeet(5,6)
