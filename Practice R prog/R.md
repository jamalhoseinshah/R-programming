# Practice R pragramming 

"R plays a key role in a wide variety of research and data analysis projects because it makes many modern statistical methods,
both simple and advanced, readily available and easy to use. It’s true, however, that a beginner toR is often new to programming in general. 
As a beginner, you must not only learn to use R for your specific data analysis goals but also learn to think like a programmer. This is partly why R has a bit of a reputation
for being “hard”—but rest assured, that really isn’t the case"
