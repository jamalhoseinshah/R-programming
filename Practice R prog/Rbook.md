# A FIRST COURSE IN R PROGRAMMING AND STATISTICS written by TILMAN M. DAVIES

"R plays a key role in a wide variety of research and data analysis projects because it makes many modern statistical methods,
both simple and advanced, readily available and easy to use. It’s true, however, that a beginner toR is often new to programming in general. 
As a beginner, you must not only learn to use R for your specific data analysis goals but also learn to think like a programmer. This is partly why R has a bit of a reputation
for being “hard”—but rest assured, that really isn’t the case"


"R is based heavily on the S language, first developed in the 1960s and 1970s by researchers at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey (for an overview, see, for
example, Becker et al., 1988). With a view to embracing open source software, R’s developers—Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in New Zealand—released it in the early 1990s under the GNU public license. (The software was named for Ross and Robert’s shared
first initial.) Since then, the popularity of R has grown in leaps and bounds because of its unrivaled flexibility for data analysis and powerful graphical
tools, all available for the princely sum of nothing. Perhaps the most appealing feature of R is that any researcher can contribute code in the form ofpackages (or libraries), so the rest of the world has fast access to developments in statistics and data science (see Section A.2).
Today, the main source code archives are maintained by a dedicated group known as the R Core Team, and R is a collaborative effort. You can find
the names of the most prominent contributors at http://www.r-project.org/; these individuals deserve thanks for their ongoing efforts, which keep R alive
and at the forefront of statistical computing!The team issues updated versions of R relatively frequently. There
have been substantial changes to the software over time, though neighboring versions are typically similar to one another. In this book, I’ve employed
versions 3.0.1–3.2.2. You can find out what’s new in the latest version"
